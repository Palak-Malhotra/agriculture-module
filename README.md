# üåæ Agriculture Module

The **Agriculture Module** is a React-based web application that predicts crop yields based on user input such as location and crop type. This project is part of an initiative to leverage machine learning and web development to assist farmers, researchers, and policymakers in understanding agricultural productivity.

## üöÄ Features
- **Interactive UI**: A clean and user-friendly interface to input location and crop type.
- **Dynamic Predictions**: Predict crop yields using a backend integrated with a Python-based machine learning model.
- **Real-Time Data Flow**: Seamless communication between frontend and backend to deliver accurate results.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design enabling future expansion (e.g., adding more crops or features).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
### **Frontend**
- **React**: For building an interactive user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the application with animations (e.g., a starry background).
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the frontend.

### **Backend**
- **Node.js**: For handling API requests from the frontend.
- **Express.js**: To create RESTful APIs for communication.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests between the backend and the Python API.

### **Python API**
- **Flask**: For serving the machine learning model as a REST API.
- **Flask-CORS**: To allow cross-origin requests.
